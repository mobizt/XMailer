# XMailer
The fast and lightweight async E-mail client library for Arduino. 

This E-mail client library is the [ESP-Mail-Client](https://github.com/mobizt/ESP-Mail-Client) library replacement that provides the asynchronous operation for sending E-mail via SMTP server and fetching E-mail via IMAP server.

It supports nested RFC822 message attachments sending. This E-mail client library can fetch (read) the complex embeded RFC822 message body structure. 

The IMAP message appending and idling are also supported.

This library is under development and will be available soon.
